- gates & circuits  

Understanding these concepts is essential before coding.

### 2. Working With Quantum SDKs  
Interns often use:

- Qiskit  
- Cirq  
- Braket  
- Pennylane  

These tools simulate quantum circuits and algorithms.

### 3. Building Quantum Circuits  
You’ll design circuits for:

- quantum teleportation  
- Grover’s search  
- quantum Fourier transform  
- simple error correction  

This makes concepts practical.

### 4. Running Simulations  
Quantum hardware is limited, so interns use simulators to:

- test algorithms  
- analyze outcomes  
- optimize circuits  

Simulation is a major learning tool.

### 5. Research Assistance  
Depending on the lab/company, interns may:

- prepare literature reviews  
- analyze experimental data  
- help with algorithm design  
- test new frameworks  

Quantum is a heavily research-driven field.
