## Why Programming Internships Matter

You learn more in three months of coding with a team than in three years of theory.  
Interns gain:

- real-world coding habits  
- version control experience  
- problem-solving skills  
- project architecture understanding  
- exposure to software tools  

Internships turn students into developers.
